# Covid Helpline


Its been 2 months now since the second wave of Covid has started in India. It’s spreading faster and deadlier than ever. Currently the cases are more than 4 times compared to last year’s highest recorded number. Our healthcare system has taken the biggest hit. Hospitals are out of beds & ventilators, patients are struggling for oxygen, life saving medicines are running out of stock. Many NGOs and individuals on the ground are trying to help in every shape possible. They are sharing information about available resources through different social media channels. 

However, there is a requirement to consolidate these leads and ensure this information is accessible to people on a single platform.


To solution this, I have designed this portal.  which is aimed to help the affected people to find the right resources in their city and meet their requirements in a real time basis. The system collects the data from different sources, processes it, runs it through multiple machine learning models to extract details, validates the content and shows to the user who is looking for these details.
